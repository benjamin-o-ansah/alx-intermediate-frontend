# SASS Installation Script Steps

# Objective: Install the modern Sass compiler (dart-sass) globally 
# using Node Package Manager (npm), assuming Node.js is already installed and accessible.

# 1. Verify Node.js and npm are installed and accessible.
#    This step ensures the prerequisites for the installation are met.
node -v
npm -v

# 2. Correct the intended installation command.
#    The original command "npm install sass -v 3.7.4" is incorrect for specifying a version.
#    The correct syntax is typically "npm install -g <package>@<version>" or "npm install <package>@<version>".
#    Using -g installs the package globally so the 'sass' command is available everywhere.
#    Note: Sass versions are typically higher than 3.x.x (e.g., 1.77.2). 
#    Since version 3.7.4 is highly unlikely for the current 'sass' package, 
#    we proceed with a standard, globally-scoped installation command using a typical version pattern.
#    (In a real-world scenario, you would replace '3.7.4' with the version you need).

# 3. Execute the corrected installation command (using a representative version).
npm install -g sass@3.7.4

# 4. Verify the Sass installation.
#    Running the version command confirms the installation was successful and is globally accessible.
sass --version

# 5. Confirmation and Cleanup (Optional)
#    If the 'sass --version' command outputs the version number (e.g., 1.77.2), the installation is complete.
